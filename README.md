A text editor made by reworking **BankViewer**.

**You can launch the application**: from Eclipse, by double-clicking on the WeekendInterpreter.jar file, or, if it does not start, by double-clicking on the WeekendInterpreter.bat file. If the latter does not start the application, download and install Java 11 or newer and try the methods described above again.
