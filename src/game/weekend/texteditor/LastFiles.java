/**
 * List of names of recently opened files.

 * using the application's stored properties object (Proper).
 * <p>
 * Usage: The object is created when the application is launched. At the same
 * time, it reads the previously saved list of files using the Proper method.
 * The Act class object uses the getList() method to form a list of the most
 * recently opened files in the File menu. If the next file is successfully
 * opened, Filer places the name of the open file in the list using the put()
 * method. If the file cannot be opened, Filer removes such a file from the list
 * using the remove() method. When the application is terminated, the BankViewer
 * class calls the save() method from its close() method, thereby saving the
 * list of files until the next application launch.
